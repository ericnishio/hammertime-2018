# Hammer Time 2018: Logo Design

The objective of this Hammer Time project is to improve my logo design skills in twelve days by learning creative processes and technical tricks to accelerate the design process.

I'm already familiar with Sketch as a designer's tool, but I've never been satisfied with the quality of the logos I've created so I'd like to invest time in solving this problem.
