# Hammer Time 2018: Logo Design

The objective of this twelve-day Digia R&D project is to improve my logo design skills by learning creative practices and techniques.

I will be using [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com) as my primary tool to work on logos, and pencil and paper to sketch out ideas. The learning process will vastly consist of referring to free online resources such as videos and blog posts, the best of which I will feature in this write-up.

I'm hoping that the documentation I produce during this project can serve as a stepping stone for others to pursue similar learning experiences.

## Objectives

- Improve my creative process
- Learn creative methods and hacks
- Learn new Sketch techniques
- Focus on output -> variations -> trial and error
- Recreate existing logos designed by other people
- Create a logo for our JavaScript Tribe
- Create logos for personal projects
- Document the learning process
- Document various logo creation processes
